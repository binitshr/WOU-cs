                                I recently graduated <a href="http://www.wou.edu/" target="_blank">Western Oregon University</a>
                                with a Bachelors of Science in Community public health.

                                I have taken numerous courses including but not limited to International Health, Program Evaluation, and Biometric and Research Methods; which have helped me gain valuable knowledge and understanding of health and gender disparities in our society. 		 	Additionally, I have gained valuable insights about the relationships between political, economic, cultural, educational and demographic conditions of developing countries and its impact on health and health services.

During my internship at Center for Hope and Safety where their mission is to provide a safe environment for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking and human trafficking and to educate the public about the issues surrounding victimization. I have achieved skills and knowledge to advocate, and  provide a safe place and supportive services for survivors of physical , sexual, psychological, emotional and economic abuse. I also came to an understanding of the importance and the need for women empowerment and safety through these opportunities. 
I am passionate about empowering, educating, advocating and having gender equality for women and young girls. I am eager to work with an organization that strives to achieve women’s equality and empowerment as both the objective, and as part of the solution.
